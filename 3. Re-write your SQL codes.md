# Re-write your SQL codes

### 1. Neaten Up Your SQL Code</br>
Neatening up SQL codes cannot make the codes run faster but it helps us to easily understand the codes with less spent time.</br>

### 2. Restrict Columns and Rows</br>
- Avoid **SELECT*** to restrict number of columns.</br>
- Use **WHERE** to restrict number of rows.</br>
- Make sure when use WHERE to compare to a constant value (='A' or =120 or ='12/12/2020'), the datatypes have to be matched in order to avoid implicit conversion.

### 3. INTERSECT vs INNER JOIN</br>
- Use **INTERSECT** to determine the unique common values between 2 dataset (It is faster than INNER JOIN). 
- For example: You just want to only take common ID between two tables, no need any column else, then use INTERSECT.
```
SELECT ID_A FROM table_A
INTERSECT
SELECT ID_B FROM table_B;
```
- We use **INNER JOIN** to connect 2 or more tables and take specific columns from them.


### 4. MINUS</br>
- When we need to find out the values exist only on table A, not on table B, **MINUS** function should be considered as a good option. It's even better than **IN, LEFT JOIN** about performance.
```
SELECT ID_A FROM table_A
MINUS
SELECT ID_B FROM table_B;
```


### 5. SUB-QUERY</br>
- Avoid Sub-queries as we can.
- We can re-write by simple JOIN


### 6. IN vs EXIST</br>
- If inner query small as compared to outer, then use **IN**
- If inner query large as compared to outer, then use **EXISTS**



### 7. We can use IN for multi columns</br>
- In Oracle, we can use **IN** for multi columns.
```
SELECT COUNT(*) 
  FROM table_X 
 WHERE (column_A, column_B, column_C) IN ( (11,'F','INVOICE'), 
                                           (15,'M','PAYMENT'), 
                                           (20,'M','INVOICE'));
```



### 8. Common Table Expression (CTE)</br>
- In case we have to use a sub-query many times. We can consider to use CTE to avoid rerun the sub-query.
```
WITH cte_A 
AS 
(SELECT ... 
   FROM ... 
  WHERE ...)
SELECT * FROM cte_A;
```


### 9. APPEND hint</br>
- When we execute an INSERT command, Oracle will find the place of deleted rows and insert new rows there.
- Use hint **APPEND** for inserting, that tells Oracle just append new rows at the end of this table, instead of finding deleted rows and insert new rows there.
```
INSERT /*+APPEND */ INTO table_A_plus
SELECT * FROM table_A;
```


### 10. Order of Tables on FROM Clause</br>
- The order of tables in **FROM** clause will affect to runtime of this query. 
- We should put the smallest one at first, then follow by the next smallest. 
- But when we use **indexes**, the order of those tables in **FROM** doesn't make sense.
