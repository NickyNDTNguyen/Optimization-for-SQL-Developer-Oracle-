# Re-write your SQL codes

### 1. Neaten Up Your SQL Code</br>
Neatening up SQL codes cannot make the codes run faster but it helps us to easily understand the codes with less spent time.</br>

### 2. Restrict Columns and Rows</br>
- Avoid **SELECT*** to restrict number of columns.</br>
- Use **WHERE** to restrict number of rows.</br>
- Make sure when use WHERE to compare to a constant value (='A' or =120 or ='12/12/2020'), the datatypes have to be matched in order to avoid implicit conversion.


### INTERSECT vs. INNER JOIN
Use INTERSECT to determine the unique common values between 2 dataset (It is faster than INNER JOIN). 
We use INNER join to connect 2 or more tables and take specific columns from them.

Avoid Sub-queries as we can.

We can use IN for multi columns.

Using WITH to avoid rerun sub queries if we need to use those many times.

Use hint APPEND for inserting, that tells Oracle just append new rows at the end of this table, instead of finding deleted rows and insert new rows there.

The order of tables in FROM clause will affect to runtime of this query. 
We should put the smallest one at first, then follow by the next smallest. 
But when we use indexes, the order of those tables in FROM doesn't make sense.
