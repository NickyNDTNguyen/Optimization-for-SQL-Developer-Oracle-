# Optimization for SQL Developer (Oracle)
![](https://i.imgur.com/2Xe70rC.png)

In this post, I will summarize some techniques to optimize SQL codes from my experience and some courses I went through. To effectively optimize SQL code, it depends on a combination of a lot of following things, such as: your business, your database structure, hardwares and SQL skills, etc.

It is quite difficult to present all things about SQL optimization exactly and completely, so I will just share about the most basic things. Hope it helps.

To easily approach this knowledge, I separate it into 9 parts:
  1. [General overview](./1.%20General%20overview.md)
  2. [Build up database structure](./2.%20Build%20up%20database%20structure.md)
  3. [Re-write your SQL codes](./3.%20Re-write%20your%20SQL%20codes.md)
  4. Overview of indexes
  5. B-tree index
  6. Bitmap index
  7. 
  8. 
  9.
