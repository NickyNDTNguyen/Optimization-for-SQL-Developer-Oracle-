# Build up database structure
### Primary Key/Foreign Key<br/>
Primary Key: Column(s) containing unique, non-NULL values.<br/>
Foreign Key: Column(s) that is the primary key of another table. We use it to join between 2 tables.<br/>
Oracle put Index on PK, not FK.<br/>

**Normal Forms (First, Second, Third)**<br/>
Skinny tables (tables have less columns) = Faster queries.<br/>
Oracle stores data in a platter and use an armature to read/write data.<br/>
Oracle stores data in row after row, so when armature read/write rows, it needs to wait platter spin around from row to row, if the row is too large, it takes time for Oracle to move to the next one.<br/>


**Primary Key/Foreign Key Redux**<br/>

**Columns Accessed Infrequently**<br/>

**NULLs**<br/>
Put the columns which have high probability to have NULL in value at the end of table.<br/>
If we have a NULL value at the middle of a row, we still have to go to the end of this row before start to the next row.<br/>
But if we have the NULL values at the end of row, we can immediately move to next row instead of go to the end of this row.<br/>
