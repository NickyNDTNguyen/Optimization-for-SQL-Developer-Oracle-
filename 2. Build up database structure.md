# Build up database structure
### Primary Key/Foreign Key<br/>
**Primary Key:** Column(s) containing unique, non-NULL values.<br/>
**Foreign Key:** Column(s) that is the primary key of another table. We use it to join between 2 tables.<br/>
Oracle put Index on PK, so it will increase the speed when we access these tables via the key.<br/>

### Normal Forms (First, Second, Third)
Take a look on the following examples to understand Normal Forms:<br/>

**First Normal Form**<br/>
We require both **Full Name** and **Physical Address** to identify a record uniquely.<br/>

**Second Normal Form**<br/>
We move column **Movies Rented** to another table, they join to each other by column **Membership ID**.<br/>

**Third Normal Form**<br/>
Subsequently, we continue to move column **Salutation** to another table, they join to each other by column **Salutation ID**.</br>

In 3NF, we just store columns that directly associated with Primary Key.</br>
Ex: We have table A with PK is based on 3 columns, if we have column X relates to one of 3 columns in PK, then move X out of table A.<br/>


### **Third Normal Form (3NF)**<br/>
3NF is a form that remove redundant columns or move these columns to other tables. This kind of form will help us to decrease query runtime. **Skinny tables (tables have less columns) = Faster queries.<br/>**

Oracle stores data in a platter and use an armature to read/write data.<br/>
Oracle stores data in row after row, so when armature read/write rows, it needs to wait platter spin around from row to row, if the row is too large, it takes time for Oracle to move to the next one.<br/>

### **Fact and Dimension tables**<br/>
Based on the idea "The more skinnier, the more faster" and 3NF, we have definition about Fact table and Dimension table for storing data.</br>

### **Columns Accessed Infrequently**<br/>

### **NULLs**<br/>
Put the columns which have high probability to have NULL in value at the end of table.<br/>
If we have a NULL value at the middle of a row, we still have to go to the end of this row before start to the next row.<br/>
But if we have the NULL values at the end of row, we can immediately move to next row instead of go to the end of this row.<br/>
