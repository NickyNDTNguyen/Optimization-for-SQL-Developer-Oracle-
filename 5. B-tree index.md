# B-tree index

B-Tree Index is a general purpose index.
We can index one, two or more columns: simple or composite index.
Choosing columns to index depends on the columns that are referenced on WHERE clause.
All ROWID for each value of the column (which we put index) are gathered and placed in the index.
The space for index is less than entire tables' space, so the armature go through it much faster than entire table.
Index is used for subsetting data.
Index is used for data integrity.
Index is used for speed up join.
We don't need to create a simple index on a column which is in a composite index. Because when we access only this column, the composite index can also be used.
The order of columns in a composite index is important.
(Most selective, Least selective). If we use the second column in WHERE clause, it will lead to use INDEX SKIP SCAN.
(Least distinctive, Most distinctive). That means put the highest unique values column first, it will help to reduce number of rows in result set.
Index is used for quality and range conditions (=,>,< BETWEEN) and the not equal conditions, such as: !=, <>, IS NOT won't be considered. In other words, Indexes are used to find data that is there, not for the data that is not there.

```
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name(column_name);
--
SELECT OWNER, TABLE_NAME, TABLESPACE_NAME FROM ALL_TABLES WHERE OWNER='SCOTT' ORDER BY TABLE_NAME;
SELECT TABLE_NAME, TABLESPACE_NAME FROM USER_TABLES ORDER BY TABLE_NAME;
--
SELECT TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE, DATA_LENGTH, NULLABLE FROM ALL_TAB_COLUMNS WHERE OWNER='SCOTT' AND TABLE_NAME='CANDYBAR_FACT' ORDER BY COLUMN_ID;
SELECT TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE, DATA_LENGTH, NULLABLE FROM USER_TAB_COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME='CANDYBAR_FACT' ORDER BY COLUMN_ID;
--
SELECT OWNER, INDEX_NAME, TABLE_OWNER, TABLE_NAME, TABLESPACE_NAME FROM ALL_INDEXES WHERE OWNER='SCOTT' ORDER BY INDEX_NAME, TABLE_OWNER, TABLE_NAME;
SELECT INDEX_NAME, TABLE_OWNER, TABLE_NAME, TABLESPACE_NAME FROM USER_INDEXES ORDER BY INDEX_NAME, TABLE_OWNER;
SELECT TABLE_NAME, INDEX_NAME, COLUMN_NAME FROM ALL_IND_COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_OWNER='SCOTT' ORDER BY TABLE_NAME, INDEX_NAME, COLUMN_POSITION;
SELECT TABLE_NAME, INDEX_NAME, COLUMN_NAME FROM USER_IND_COLUMNS ORDER BY TABLE_NAME, INDEX_NAME, COLUMN_POSITION;
--
DROP INDEX index_name;
```

After create an index, we have to gather statistics, otherwise Oracle won't consider it. From Oracle 10g, the new indexes will be gathered automatically if the table it is based on has data.
Oracle just considers to use index if the result set is equal or less than 15% entire this table. Otherwise, there is no need for that index, except for JOINS or integrity data.
