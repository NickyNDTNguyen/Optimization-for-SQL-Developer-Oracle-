# Overview of indexes

### Pros:
- Avoid full table scan
- Jump to desired rows
- Speed up JOIN
- Speed up COUNT(): Because just count only Index columns will be slimmer than entire table, so it will be faster.
- Speed up ORDER BY
- Speed up GROUP BY
- Avoid duplication
- Queries will run faster
### Cons:
- Waste space: So we should create indexes on neccesary columns instead of all. When we create an index on one or multi columns, we have to consider carefully whether we need to use these columns, otherwise the index will waste space.
- Indexes are useful when we access a small portion (equal or less then 15%) of database, if we access entire a table, Oracle will ignore the indexes on this table.
- INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE can be slow because not only data is modified, but also the corresponding indexes on this table.
- The index can be affected by Hard Drive. Sometimes, the powerful hardware can help the FULL TABLE SCAN is faster than INDEX scan.

### Kinds of Index:
- B-tree Index is an upside down of a tree with each leaf is a rowid. We use this kind of index for ID, char, number, date, ...
- Bitmap Index is used for columns with a few distinct values (Ex: male/female)
- Function-Based Index is an index which is built on a function applied to columns (Ex: CREATE INDEX first_name_idx ON user_data (gender, UPPER(first_name), dob)), Oracle developed this kind of index to avoid when we use a function on an index column, this regular index will not be called.
